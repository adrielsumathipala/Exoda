## Exoda's Origin: How Refugees and Migrants Move

I built Exoda with a single question in mindâ€”how do **people move** on a global scale? Human migration, as it turns out, is a phenomenon as complex as it is data-rich. I began thinking about this question my junior year at Yale and Exoda came out as a final project for a seminar I took at Yale, called Writing and Reporting on the War, taught by renowned war reporter [Janine di Giovanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janine_di_Giovanni). While there are many migration data sources online, few provide accurate data at a global scale, and even fewer provide tools to explore this data. With Exoda, I tried to do something different. I integrated and cleaned multiple public migration data sources to create a singular ground truth on human migration. I focused on refugees, because of their inherent vulnerability, and central importance to current political discussions on immigration, national sovereignty, and human rights. I combined this data with what I hope is a powerful, useful, and intuitive set of visual tools to explore the myriad nuances of human movement. Happy searching and feel free to drop me a line with any feedback!

## Data Analysis and Viz Stack Used:

**Data Analysis:**

To clean, aggregate, and prepare the data, I used R and Python with its standard data science libraries (Numpy, Pandas, etc.). This code is in the R script and Jupyter notebook files in this repo. 


**Data Visualization:**

I custom-built all of the visualizations in Exoda using D3, the JavaScript web visualization package. The rest of the frontend was structured using Bootstrap (HTML, CSS).
